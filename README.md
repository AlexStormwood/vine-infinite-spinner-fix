# Vine Infinite Spinner Fix

Browser extension for Chrome that fixes the infinite spinner bug on Amazon Vine.

This extension does not collect, store or transmit any data. It has a single purpose: to fix the infinite spinner bug on Amazon Vine.

It will work for any Chromium browser (Chrome, Brave, Kiwi etc). It does also work for Firefox though I haven't published it to the Firefox Add-ons store.

If there is demand for Firefox then I will sort it. Otherwise you can build from source and install it locally.

## Install

Install from the [Chrome Extension Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vine-infinte-spinner-fix/cocpgahdlmjffjhkipeldohfpjbmnhgd).

## Install on Android

The Chrome extension store isn't available on mobile however you can install extensions with the Kiwi browser. Kiwi is basically Chrome.

Download Kiwi browser [here](https://kiwibrowser.com/).

## Install From Source (Chrome)

You can choose to build from source and install the extension locally instead of from the store.

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
5. Enable Developer Mode in the top right corner
6. Click `Load Unpacked` in the top left corner
7. Select the `dist` folder in the cloned repository

## Install From Source (Firefox)

Follow the steps above to build the source. Search online for how to install local addons in Firefox.
